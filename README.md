# wiki-sandbox
A repository whose sole purpose is to expose a pubic wiki for editors to draft their contributions.
To contribute documentation, go to [this repository's wiki](https://github.com/contiki-ng/wiki-sandbox/wiki), create a new page, and then submit your contribution as a new [Contiki-NG issue](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues) with a link to your page.
